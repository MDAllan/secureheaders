Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
Node.js: Download and install it from Node.js website.


npm (Node Package Manager): Comes bundled with Node.js.


MongoDB (or other database): Ensure you have access to a MongoDB instance for this project (either local or remote).


Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>

Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can check the versions by running:


node -v
npm -v

Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and install the required dependencies:


npm install

This will install all the necessary packages listed in package.json.

Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add the following variables:


# JWT Secret for token signing
JWT_SECRET=<your_secret_key>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<your_refresh_secret_key>

# MongoDB URI (or other database)
DB_URI=<your_database_uri>

# Google OAuth credentials (for SSO login)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your_google_client_id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_google_client_secret>

# Encryption key for sensitive data
BIO_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your_encryption_key>

Replace the placeholders (<your_secret_key>, <your_database_uri>, etc.) with your actual values.
Set Up Database
Make sure you have MongoDB running on your local machine or access to a remote MongoDB server. Update the .env file with the correct database URI (DB_URI):


Example:
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name

Run the Server
Once everything is set up, start the server using the following command:


npm start

This will run the server on the default port (3000 if you're using Express.js). You can change the port by modifying the server.js file:
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});

Access the API
Once the server is running, you can access the following API endpoints:
Login: POST /api/auth/login


Register: POST /api/auth/register


Logout: POST /api/auth/logout


Protected Route: GET /api/auth/dashboard (requires a valid JWT token)


You can use tools like Postman to make requests, or integrate the frontend to interact with these endpoints.

Input Validation
This application implements input validation to ensure the integrity and safety of data entered by users. The following methods are used:
Regex Validation: Input fields like email, password, etc., are validated using regular expressions to ensure proper formatting.


Custom Validation Functions: Functions are implemented to check the validity of user inputs (e.g., checking if passwords meet security requirements).


Express Validator: This middleware package is used for validating and sanitizing user inputs in route handlers. It ensures that all inputs meet the required structure.



Output Encoding
To prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, output encoding is applied in the application. The following steps are taken:
HTML Encoding: User-provided data is encoded before being sent as output in the HTML context.


Content Security Policy (CSP): Appropriate headers are set to prevent malicious scripts from executing in the browser.


Encryption Techniques
Sensitive data, such as user passwords, are encrypted using strong hashing algorithms. The following techniques are used:
Password Hashing: User passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database. The application never stores passwords in plain text.


The bcrypt library is used to hash passwords with salt to ensure added security.


JWT Tokens: For user authentication, JWT (JSON Web Token) is used. Tokens are signed with a secret key (defined in .env) to maintain the integrity of the data.


AES Encryption: Sensitive data is encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to ensure that it is stored securely, even if the database is compromised.


Third-Party Libraries
This project uses several third-party libraries to handle various tasks, such as authentication, security, and input validation. These include:
Express.js: The web framework for Node.js used to build the API.


bcrypt: A library used to hash passwords before saving them in the database.


jsonwebtoken (JWT): Used to sign and verify JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.


passport-google-oauth20: A strategy for authenticating users with Google OAuth.


express-validator: Middleware for input validation and sanitization.


cors: A package that allows you to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for your API.


dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file to manage sensitive information.
